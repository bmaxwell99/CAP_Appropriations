## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
regression_stats %>% 
  filter(p_value_d_7 <= .05) %>%
  select(State, trend = lm_d_7, lm_d_7_per_pop)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = d_7_stats ) +
  aes(x = pop_cat,
      y = mean,
      label = State) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
